## Child Pedaling (Force as a function of time)

From [src/ch14/pedal_coast.hs](../src/ch14/pedal_coast.hs)

The Force as a function of time as defined in the book was confusing to me. I
rewrote it to use modulo (since that's pretty common in programming).

From the Book:

``` haskell
pedalCoast t 
    = let tCycle = 20
          nComplete :: Int
          nComplete = truncate (t / tCycle)
          remainder = t - fromIntegral nComplete * tCycle
      in if remainder < 10
         then 10 
         else 0
```

Writing it out helps my confusion a bit - instead of using a modulo to keep `t`
between 0 and 20, the function from the book scales the `tCycle` up based on the
number of cycles that have been completed.

`truncate` is a cool function, which lops the decimal off a `Double` value.
