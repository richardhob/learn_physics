# Learning Physics with Haskell Project

Adapt what we're learning in the book to something that actually works with
cabal / haskell or whatever.

## Notes

- [Graphing](notes/graphing.md)
- [CH14](notes/ch14.md)

## Organization

Examples are kept as Executables in the `learn_physics.cabal` file. Depending on
how many examples there are, the examples MAY be removed periodically.

The main notes from each chapter will be put into the `Physics` library. 

So far:

- Physics.Newton2 -> Newtonian physics stuff from chapter 14
